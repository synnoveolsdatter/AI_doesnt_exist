# Siri Isn't an AI.
It just isn't, and this is an interface/skeleton project based on how Siri works to prove that Siri isn't an AI. It's not magical, and Machine Learning <b>ISN'T</b> AI. This is, of course, written without using machine learning because people often mistake it for AI.

My logic is that if I can write a program that runs similarly to how Siri works using just C (no ML because people often mistake ML for AI) then I can prove that Siri was written without ML, as ML tends to be more RAM / CPU intensive.

Lastly, the <b>real</b> Siri "understands" you by parsing your sentence into tokens (like a compiler) and is written in a much more sophisticated way than I did here in just 5 hours.
